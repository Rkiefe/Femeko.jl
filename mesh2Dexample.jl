    An example on how to create a 2D model and generate a mesh
    with local refinement

    The model is a square with two holes inside and a bounding shell
    around the square

    Note: You set the holes last. 
    	. First add the square
    	. Then the bounding shell
    	. Unify the geometry so that the mesh process sees both geometries as 'one model'
		. Then add the holes
	Note: The holes only see the 'cells', this way you can't occCut the 'box'

	# Add a bounding shell
	box = addDisk([0,0,0], 7.0)
	shell_id = unifyModel(cells, box)

	# Add a hole
    id = addDisk([-0.75,0,0], 0.2)
	cells = occCut(cells, [2, id])

    # Add another hole

	mesh::MESH = Mesh2D(cells, meshSize, localSize)
